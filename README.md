Here's a **crystal clear, visually engaging explanation** of the 5 shared subtopics under **"Module Overview: Monitoring with Prometheus"** using intuitive icons and structured formatting:

---

### 📘 **1. Introduction to Monitoring with Prometheus**

🧠 **What You’ll Learn**:

* How to **monitor a Kubernetes cluster** running a microservices app.
* **Why monitoring matters** — recognizing its **value and use cases**.
* A dive into **Prometheus**:

  * 🔍 What it is
  * ⚙️ How it works
  * 🧭 How to use it in real-world clusters

💡 **Purpose**:
Before jumping into technical setup, it’s crucial to understand the *"why"* behind monitoring and the foundational tools used — especially **Prometheus**, the core of this module.

---

### 🛠️ **2. Overview of the Hands-On Project**

📦 **Project Breakdown**:

* 🚀 **Create a Kubernetes Cluster** using **Amazon EKS**
* 🛒 **Deploy an Online Shop Microservices Application**
* 🧪 **Implement Prometheus Monitoring Stack**:

  * See how Kubernetes components are **automatically discovered**.
  * Understand **real deployment behaviors** of monitoring tools.

🎯 **Goal**:
Hands-on exposure to setting up a **full-stack monitoring environment**, which mimics real-world production clusters.

---

### 🖥️ **3. Understanding What to Monitor – Cluster Nodes**

📊 **Primary Target**: **Cluster Nodes**

🧩 What to Monitor:

* 💻 **CPU Usage**
* 🧠 **RAM Consumption**
* 💾 **Storage Availability**

⚠️ **Why It Matters**:

> If a node is low on resources, **pods can’t run** on it → this leads to **deployment failures**.

🔍 **Insight**:
Start monitoring at the *infrastructure layer* to ensure the cluster has the **capacity to operate effectively**.

---

### 📦 **4. Monitoring Kubernetes Components**

🧩 **Key Kubernetes Resources**:

* 📦 **Pods**
* 🔁 **Deployments**
* 🔗 **Services**

🔍 **What You Look For**:

* Are pods **running correctly**?
* Any pods **crashing** or **failing to start**?
* Are **services accessible** across the cluster?

🌐 **Why It's Important**:
Knowing whether your Kubernetes **objects** are stable helps ensure your application is **healthy and available**.

---

### 🧠 **5. Monitoring Third-Party Applications (Redis Example)**

📌 **Use Case**: Monitoring **Redis**

🧪 Redis is used by one of the microservices for **in-memory storage**.

🕵️‍♂️ **What You Want to Know**:

* 📶 Is Redis **accepting connections**?
* 🔒 Is it **secure and available**?
* 💥 Has it **crashed or failed**?

🔄 **How You Monitor It**:

* 🧰 **Deploy a Redis Exporter** → converts Redis metrics into **Prometheus-readable format**
* Prometheus can then **scrape metrics** and **alert on Redis health**

✅ **Benefit**:
Instant visibility into the **operational state** of essential third-party services your app depends on.
