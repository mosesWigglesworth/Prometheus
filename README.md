****16 - Module Overview Monitoring with Prometheus
****
### 📘 **1. Introduction to Monitoring with Prometheus**

🧠 **What You’ll Learn**:

* How to **monitor a Kubernetes cluster** running a microservices app.
* **Why monitoring matters** — recognizing its **value and use cases**.
* A dive into **Prometheus**:

  * 🔍 What it is
  * ⚙️ How it works
  * 🧭 How to use it in real-world clusters

💡 **Purpose**:
Before jumping into technical setup, it’s crucial to understand the *"why"* behind monitoring and the foundational tools used — especially **Prometheus**, the core of this module.

---

### 🛠️ **2. Overview of the Hands-On Project**

📦 **Project Breakdown**:

* 🚀 **Create a Kubernetes Cluster** using **Amazon EKS**
* 🛒 **Deploy an Online Shop Microservices Application**
* 🧪 **Implement Prometheus Monitoring Stack**:

  * See how Kubernetes components are **automatically discovered**.
  * Understand **real deployment behaviors** of monitoring tools.

🎯 **Goal**:
Hands-on exposure to setting up a **full-stack monitoring environment**, which mimics real-world production clusters.

---

### 🖥️ **3. Understanding What to Monitor – Cluster Nodes**

📊 **Primary Target**: **Cluster Nodes**

🧩 What to Monitor:

* 💻 **CPU Usage**
* 🧠 **RAM Consumption**
* 💾 **Storage Availability**

⚠️ **Why It Matters**:

> If a node is low on resources, **pods can’t run** on it → this leads to **deployment failures**.

🔍 **Insight**:
Start monitoring at the *infrastructure layer* to ensure the cluster has the **capacity to operate effectively**.

---

### 📦 **4. Monitoring Kubernetes Components**

🧩 **Key Kubernetes Resources**:

* 📦 **Pods**
* 🔁 **Deployments**
* 🔗 **Services**

🔍 **What You Look For**:

* Are pods **running correctly**?
* Any pods **crashing** or **failing to start**?
* Are **services accessible** across the cluster?

🌐 **Why It's Important**:
Knowing whether your Kubernetes **objects** are stable helps ensure your application is **healthy and available**.

---

### 🧠 **5. Monitoring Third-Party Applications (Redis Example)**

📌 **Use Case**: Monitoring **Redis**

🧪 Redis is used by one of the microservices for **in-memory storage**.

🕵️‍♂️ **What You Want to Know**:

* 📶 Is Redis **accepting connections**?
* 🔒 Is it **secure and available**?
* 💥 Has it **crashed or failed**?

🔄 **How You Monitor It**:

* 🧰 **Deploy a Redis Exporter** → converts Redis metrics into **Prometheus-readable format**
* Prometheus can then **scrape metrics** and **alert on Redis health**

✅ **Benefit**:
Instant visibility into the **operational state** of essential third-party services your app depends on.

Absolutely! Let’s complete the remaining subtopics of the “Module Overview: Monitoring with Prometheus” in a crystal-clear, interactive, and easy-to-absorb format. At the end, you’ll also get a concise summary of all 10 subtopics. 🚀📊🧠

🔧 6. Monitoring Custom Microservices

📥 What if you want to monitor your own app?

* Imagine your microservice is getting a flood of requests. How do you know? 🤔
* Or what if your payment service is returning 500 Internal Server Errors? ⚠️

🔍 Here’s what you’ll do:

* Use Prometheus-compatible client libraries (for languages like Go, Python, Java, Node.js).
* ⏱️ Expose custom metrics like:

  * Total requests
  * Error count
  * Request duration
* Prometheus scrapes these app-specific metrics via HTTP endpoints.

🧪 Outcome:
Custom telemetry = Full observability into your app’s inner workings. 🎯

📚 7. Multi-Level Monitoring Approach

📡 Monitoring isn't one-dimensional — it's a pyramid! Here’s what’s included:

🧱 Infrastructure Level:

* CPU 🧠
* RAM 📦
* Disk & Network I/O 📡

🧩 Platform Level (Kubernetes):

* Pods, Deployments, Services 👷‍♂️
* Health checks, Restarts ♻️

🧠 Application Level:

* 🧰 Your custom microservices (as learned above)
* 🔄 Third-party apps like Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ

🧭 Goal:
You monitor every layer — from hardware → platform → software. Nothing slips through the cracks.

---

📊 8. Visualizing Monitoring Data

🔎 Now you have lots of data. But how do you read it efficiently?

🧰 Tools:

* Prometheus Web UI:

  * Raw data viewer
  * Target inspection

* Grafana (💎 Star of the show!):

  * Create beautiful dashboards
  * View metrics over time
  * Use panels like graphs 📈, tables 📋, heatmaps 🔥

💡 Example Use Cases:

* See spike in CPU usage for a node 🔺
* Detect an unusual drop in user requests on a microservice 🕵️‍♀️

🎨 Result:
Visual intelligence = actionable insights at a glance.

---

🔔 9. Why Alerts Are Necessary

👁️‍🗨️ Truth: You can't stare at Grafana all day.

⛑️ Instead, use alerts to tell you when:

* A pod keeps crashing 💥
* CPU usage hits 95% ⚠️
* Your API error rate spikes 🚨

🧘 You want peace of mind, not dashboard fatigue.

📣 Alerts = Signal in the noise
They cut through the calm and shout when things go wrong.

—

📤 10. Setting Up Alerts and Alertmanager

⚙️ Components:

* Alert Rules (in Prometheus):
  e.g., “If pod\_status = CrashLoopBackOff for 5 minutes → Fire alert!”

* Alertmanager:

  * 📬 Sends alerts via:

    * Email ✉️
    * Slack 💬
    * PagerDuty 🧯
    * Webhooks 🌐

💌 Example:
You get an email saying: “Payment-service has failed 3 times in the last 10 minutes.”

🎯 Purpose:
Real-time awareness → Fast action → Downtime minimized 🚑
